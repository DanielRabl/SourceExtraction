# SourceExtraction

Drag files on the .exe to extract all the resource and source files from Visual Studio projects. Folder like ".vs", "Debug", "Release", "x64", "x86" are ignored, to keep size low. If you execute the .exe alone, it will extract all folders in the current directory. It will try to extract the correct folders.
